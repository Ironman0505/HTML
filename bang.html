<p class="para1">The city’s nucleus was a settlement around a mud fort, built in 1537 by a local chief, Kempe Gowda. The fort was reconstructed of stone in 1761. Bangalore was the headquarters of the British administration from 1831 to 1881, when the raja was restored. However, Britain retained an administrative and military presence in the city until Indian independence in 1947. Bangalore subsequently became the capital of the new state of Mysore and remained the capital during the reorganization of states in 1956; Mysore was renamed Karnataka in 1973..</p>
<p class="para2">Bengaluru has pleasant summers and mild winters. Summer temperatures average in the low to mid-90s F (about 34 °C), and winter temperatures rarely drop below 60 °F (16 °C). The city receives about 36 inches (914 mm) of annual rainfall, which has been inadequate as a water supply for its increasing population and industry. Most of the city’s water comes from the Kaveri (Cauvery) River, about 45 miles (70 km) to the south. The municipal government has undertaken projects to develop more reservoir lakes in the city and to reuse water.

    Prominent buildings include the legislative building Vidhana Soudha (1956) and the High Court building Attara Kacheri (1867), which are situated across from one another. Also of note are the maharaja of Mysore’s palace, the Mysore Government Museum (1866), and Tippu Sultan’s fort and palace. Notable local scenic spots are the Lalbagh (Lal Bagh) Botanical Garden (laid out in the 18th century), Cubbon Park (a garden with a lake, an aquarium, and a library), Hesaraghatta Lake, and Chamaraja Lake Reservoir. Nandi Hills (Nandigunda), a hill-station summer resort 38 miles (61 km) north, is the site of two temples dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.</p>
